# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We welcome all contributions from anyone who is willing to work in good faith with our community. No contribution is too small, and all contributions are valued.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a GitHub account.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Make sure you're familiar with the project's Code of Conduct.

## Making Changes
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    - This is usually the main branch.
    - Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
- Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

## Submitting Changes

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the repository in our organization.
- After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Code Review

The project maintainers will review your changes. Reviews will be done as quickly as possible, but the project is largely maintained by a group of volunteers, so please be patient.
